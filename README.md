# Product Description Generator

## Overview
This project leverages the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and OpenAI's powerful language models, accessible via Cloudflare's AI platform, to automatically generate descriptive text for products from images. The application is written in Python and uses machine learning techniques to recognize text within images and then employs the OpenAI API to expand that text into a full-fledged product description.

## How It Works
1. **Image Processing**: The system takes an image as input and uses OCR to detect and extract text present on the product.
2. **Text Enhancement**: The extracted text is passed to OpenAI's language model to generate a coherent and detailed description of the product.
3. **Output**: The application outputs a complete product description that can be used for e-commerce listings, inventory management, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **OCR Library**: For text detection and extraction from images.
- **OpenAI API**: Accessed via Cloudflare for natural language processing and text generation.
- **Cloudflare**: Provides a seamless and scalable way to use OpenAI's API.
